## Project Description

I choose to build Battleship because it is a game that I used to play a lot when I was a kid and also beacause I thought it woukd be challenging and, thus, would help me in better understanding OOP. 

## Rules

 Each player should pick a name and then the first player will choose the size of the board that will be used to play. After that, each player will have to pick a starting cell for the corresponding ship and then enter the direection to which they want the cells of the board to be filled by the ship. For example, when positioning the 5 cell ship, if player 1 types "A1" when entering the cell, and then types "horizontal derecha" in the direction, cells A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 will be filled with this ship. After all ships have been positioned in the board, each player will be asked to shoot and will receive a message whether they have hit a ship or not. In case they hit a ship, they will be allowed to shoot once again. Oherwise, it will be the other players turn.

## Workflow

I first sat down with a notepad and thought about the structure of the game. Once that was clear, I started programming. During the programming phase, many ideas occured to me that would make the game even better and I noted those ideas on Trello so I could build upon those whenever I could.

## Organization

In order to organize my work I used Trello. I had never used it before and I think it is a very useful way to clarify what are the steps that need to be taken in order to successfully deliver the project. Also, when programmin, new ideas occur and you also see bugs that need to be fixed. Noting all those on Trello helps you not forget about them. Also, note that I added a deposit called "Versiones Futuras" that includes improvements that can be made on the game in order to make it more intelligent, pretty, etc.
